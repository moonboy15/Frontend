Put the garlic in the saucepan. Cook for 20 seconds. Combine cornstarch with 3 tablespoons of water. Stir until blended. Pour the mixture into the pan. Continuously stir while cooking until mixture thickens. Set aside. Make the fresh lumpia wrapper by beating eggs in a bowl. Stir-in cooking oil and add water. Gradually add all-purpose flour. Continue stirring until all ingredients are well blended. Note: you can let the mixture pass through a strainer to filter lumps. Cook the wrapper by heating a non-stick pan. Grease it with oil. Pour wrapper mixture into the pan enough to cover the area. Continue cooking using medium heat until the wrapper can freely slide on the pan when you shake it. Transfer the wrapper to a clean plate. Note: do the same step until the mixture is fully consumed. Assemble the lumpiang ubod by laying a piece of wrapper flat on a plate. Place a piece of lettuce leaf over the wrapper. Scoop a good amount of filling (hearts of palm) over the lettuce. Gently wrap. Arrange the wrapped lumpia on a serving plate. Pour sauce over it and finish by topping it with crushed peanuts. Serve.

Using a knife, cut and discard the stem portion. Cut vertically into two halves. Slice each half thinly. In a bowl, place shredded banana heart and about 2 tablespoons of rock salt. Let sit for about 10 to 15 minutes. Squeeze well to dispel liquid and rinse a few times under cold, running water to remove saltiness. Peel and discard the outer, fibrous skin layers of the banana heart until you reach the lighter, softer core. Trim off the stem and discard. Cut banana core into half and slice thinly. In a bowl of cold salted water, place shredded banana and soak for about 15 to 20 minutes. Using hands, squeeze to release bitter sap. Rinse with cold water and drain well, discarding liquid. In a pan over medium heat, heat oil. Add onions and garlic and cook until softened. Add pork and cook, breaking apart with the back of a spoon, until lightly browned. Add banana heart. Season with salt to taste and generously with pepper. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes or until softened and releases liquid. Add water and bring to a boil. Lower heat, cover, and cook for about 10 to 15 minutes or until tender. Add oyster sauce and chili peppers. Stir to combine. Continue to cook until liquid is reduced and vegetable and pork are cooked through. Separate wrappers into individual sheets. On a flat working surface, lay a wrapper like a diamond. Remove from heat and drain well in a colander. Allow to cool completely. Place about 1 heaping tablespoon of vegetable mixture in the middle of the diamond. Fold bottom pointed end of wrapper over filling. Fold side ends of the sheet inward and roll into a log. Wet the pointed edge of the wrapper with water to completely seal. Repeat with the remaining mixture. In a skillet over medium heat, heat about 1 inch deep of oil. Add lumpia seam side down and fry, turning once or twice, for about 3 to 5 minutes on each side or until golden brown and crisp. Remove from the pan and drain on a wire rack set over a baking sheet.

Discard aromatics and reserve 4 cups of the broth. In a large bowl, stand an ear of corn up and using a small knife, thinly cut the kernels off from top to bottom. Rotate the corn when done with each section to get to the next. Scrape the sides of the cobs using a spoon to extract the remaining pulp and milky juice. Add corn and soy sauce to the pot. Cook for medium heat for about 8 to 10 minutes or until tender. Add chicken. In a small bowl, combine 3 teaspoons of the cornstarch with ¼ cup water. Stir until dissolved and smooth. Add cornstarch slurry to the pot, whisking vigorously to prevent lumps. Continue to whisk until the mixture begins to thicken. Lower heat to a gentle simmer. In a bowl, combine eggs and the remaining 1 teaspoon cornstarch. Whisk together until smooth. Slowly drizzle the egg mixture into the soup and let it stand for 15 seconds and then stir gently to break up. Season the soup with salt and pepper to taste.
