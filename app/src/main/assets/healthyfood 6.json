In a bowl, place shredded banana heart and about 2 tablespoons of\nsalt. Let sit for about 10 to 15 minutes.\nSqueeze well to dispel liquid and rinse a few times under cold, running water to remove saltiness.\nPeel and discard the outer, fibrous skin layers of the banana heart until you reach the lighter, softer core.\nTrim off the stem and discard. Cut banana core into half and slice thinly.\nIn a bowl of cold salted water, place shredded banana and soak for about 15 to 20 minutes.\nUsing hands, squeeze to release bitter sap.\nRinse with cold water and drain well, discarding liquid. In a pan over medium heat, heat oil.\nAdd onions and garlic and cook until softened.\nAdd pork and cook, breaking apart with the back of a spoon, until lightly browned.\nAdd banana heart. Season with salt to taste and generously with pepper.\nContinue to cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes or until softened and releases liquid. Add water and bring to a boil.\nLower heat, cover, and cook for about 10 to 15 minutes or until tender.\nAdd oyster sauce and chili peppers. Stir to combine.\nContinue to cook until liquid is reduced and vegetable and pork are cooked through.\nSeparate wrappers into individual sheets.\nOn a flat working surface, lay a wrapper like a diamond.\nRemove from heat and drain well in a colander.\nAllow to cool completely.\nPlace about 1 heaping tablespoon of vegetable mixture in the middle of the diamond.\nFold bottom pointed end of wrapper over filling.\nFold side ends of the sheet inward and roll into a log.\nWet the pointed edge of the wrapper with water to completely seal.\nRepeat with the remaining mixture.\nIn a skillet over medium heat, heat about 1 inch deep of oil.\nAdd lumpia seam side down and fry, turning once or twice, for about 3 to 5 minutes on each side or until golden brown and crisp.\nRemove from the pan and drain on a wire rack set over a baking sheet.\nServe hot with a spiced vinegar dip.",
